# DialerAndroid
An app that acts as a dialer, with a “keypad” to enter the number to call.

Includes a set of 3 “speed dial” buttons (memories); when the user does a long press on one of these “speed dials”/memories, the user will be allowed to update the speed dial details (define a name and associate a phone number).
